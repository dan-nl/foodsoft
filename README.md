Web-based software to manage a non-profit food coop (product catalog, ordering, accounting, job scheduling).

A food cooperative is a group of people that buy food from suppliers of their own choosing. A collective do-it-yourself supermarket. Members  order their products online and collect them on a specified day. And all put in a bit of work to make that possible. Foodsoft facilitates the process.

If you're a food coop considering to use foodsoft, please have a look at the [wiki page for foodcoops](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/For-foodcoops). When you'd like to experiment with or develop foodsoft, you can read [how to set it up](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/blob/master/doc/SETUP_DEVELOPMENT.md) on your own computer.

More information about using this software and contributing can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki).
